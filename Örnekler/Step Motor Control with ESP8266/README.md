## Step Motor Control with ESP8266

in this application, you will control the step motor via the WEB Server opened using ESP8266. Step motors are electromechanically devices that convert electrical energy into physical energy with rotary motion. As the name suggests, these motors run step by step. They continue their movement by opening and closing of the coils in order. in this example, the step motor used was 4-phase with 4 coils inside. Step motors are controlled by very high-speed switching motor drives and motor control boards. The step motor driver we used drives the motor according to the signals it receives from Arduino.

Let's set up the circuit and then start writing our project code.
