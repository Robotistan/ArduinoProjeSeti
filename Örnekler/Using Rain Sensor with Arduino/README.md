## Using Rain Sensor with Arduino

lf the weather is rainy, when the amount of water above the rain sensor exceeds a certain threshold, it will send a signal and the buzzer on the circuit will start to make sound. We prepared this circuit to give an alarm according to the signal received via the analog pin. The rain sensor consists of two electrodes. it informs us by measuring the conductivity between the electrodes. Water drops on the sensor increase the conductivity between the electrodes. The sensor sends this data as analog and digital outputs.
You will read the data from the rain sensor in the code and ensure that it will sound alarm with the buzzer when it rains.


Let's set up the circuit and then start writing our project code.
